⚡ Color System 
Primary colour is Soft Terracotta(Light Brown) #bd8a6f - it symbolises luxury, elegance and heritage. This has inspired backgrounds for the header, accordions, hover, buttons and a few icons.
 Second colour is amber yellow #f4c542 symbolizingg warmth, luxury and prosperity. For its ability to grab attention without being harsh, we have used it as background for about page, and button hover effect. It perfectly complements the primary colour. 
 The third colour is black, which has been used for the texts. 
 
 ⚡ Creative Divergence Beyond the colour system, here's how Afriluxe diverges creatively: 
  1. Typography- Afriluxe uses sans-serif for headings and body to enhance readability and neatness.
  2. Imagery- Afrocentric illustrations and organic shapes replaced the wellness characters to match the brand's cultural authenticity. 
  3. Components- custom iconography and badge-style categories like Tabasamu, Mwaki 2-piece, etc., to enhance storytelling. 
  4. Grid layouts- certain sections like testimonials were expanded from the original single-column to dynamic responsive grids, offering a more editorial feed. 
  5. Cultural touchpoints- Inclusion of Swahili and local names in products(gallery), background image for African print inspired by African textiles and Culture.

  ⚡ Breakpoint Logic
  1. SM max-width 600px for mobile devices. Switches to single column, the maibar is hidden hence the hamburger is displayed. 
  2. MD max-width 768px for tablets. Still staked  but with a tighter spacing.

⚡  Happy Building! Inspired by heritage. Powered by code.
