  ⚡ ⚡ Color System 
 
 1. Primary colour is Soft Terracotta(Light Brown) #bd8a6f - it symbolises luxury, elegance, and heritage. This has inspired backgrounds for the header, accordions, hover, buttons, and a few icons.
 
 2. The second colour is amber yellow #f4c542, which symbolizes
warmth, luxury, and prosperity. For its ability to grab attention without harshness, we have used it as a background for the about page and a button hover effect. It perfectly complements the primary colour.



4. The third colour is black, which has been used for the texts. 
 
 ⚡ ⚡ Creative Divergence Beyond the colour system, here's how Afriluxe diverges creatively: 
  1. Typography- Afriluxe uses sans-serif for headings and body to enhance readability and neatness.
  2. Imagery- Afrocentric illustrations and organic shapes replaced the wellness characters to match the brand's cultural authenticity. 
  3. Components: Custom iconography and badge-style categories, such as Tabasamu, Mwaki 2-piece, etc., to enhance storytelling. 
  4. Grid layouts—Certain sections, like testimonials, were expanded from the original single-column to dynamic responsive grids, offering a more editorial feed. 
  5. Cultural touchpoints- Inclusion of Swahili and local names in products(gallery), background image for African print inspired by African textiles and Culture.
     

⚡  ⚡Breakpoint Logic
  1. SM max width is 600px for mobile devices. When the column switches to a single column, the minibar is hidden, and the hamburger is displayed. 
  2. MD max-width 768px for tablets. Still staked  but with a tighter spacing.
